# Python Stock Market Analysis Tool
 A small project created in my sophmore year of college for my Python Scripting class. It comes with a journal that details my decision making and progress throughout the semester. Contains work with pandas, numpy, api implementation, and jupyter notebooks. Utilizes the Stocker tool as the meat of the project. I do not claim the Stocker tool as my own.
